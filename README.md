# BST_TREE
Binary Tree Data Structure
This is a visual studio .sln project
It is a binary tree that takes in a text file containing random integers
The code is available to look at for reference
You can also change the points.txt file to add more data points, Since this tree takes generic arguments
you can add strings to the list or integers
